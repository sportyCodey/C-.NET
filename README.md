# C_Sharp.NET
Some of my work in C#.NET

I plan on taking Advanced C#.NET programming either in Fall 2018 or Spring 2019. As of now, I am 100% self-taught in C#.
It's not too difficult since C# resembles Java and C++ (both which I'm very familiar with). The programs here don't show any
GUI made from Microsoft Visual Studio. I'm also learning my around that IDE and the powerful things it can do, which includes
the drag and drop GUI. 

There aren't many programs to display becuase I'm still in the process of self teaching myself the language (basically the syntax). 
The programs are textbook problems. I'm trying to get down the syntax and pick up other things that Java and C++ do not have. 

I'm excited to self-teach myself how to incorporate GUI in my applications when I get there in the textbook.
I want to post my appliations on the Windows store once I get good enough.
