Some of my work in C#.NET

Before I get into the details, here's a quick run down of each folder posted:

The screenshots of some practice GUI I made: Screenshots

My C# code: Code

I plan on taking Advanced C#.NET programming either in Fall 2018 or Spring 2019. As of now, I am 100% self-taught in C#.
It's not too difficult to learn since C# resembles Java and C++ (both of which I'm very familiar with). Some files are screenshots of
basic GUI made from Microsoft Visual Studio. I'm also learning my way around that IDE and the powerful things it can do, which includes
the drag and drop GUI. 

There aren't many programs to display becuase I'm still in the process of self teaching myself the language (basically the syntax). 
The programs are solutions to textbook problems from Visual C# How to Program Sixth Edition by Deitel. I'm trying to get down the syntax and pick up other things that Java and C++ do not have.

I'm excited to self-teach myself how to incorporate code with GUI in my applications. I want to post my applications on the Windows store once I get good enough.

These files are in no specific order.
